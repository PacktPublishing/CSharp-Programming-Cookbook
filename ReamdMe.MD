The installation of Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 fails when you do not install the update KB 2919355 Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 update: April 2014. 

You can verify that KB2919355 is installed on your computer by going to Control Panel > Programs and Features > View Installed updates and looking for "Update for Microsoft Windows (KB2919355)."
If you cannot find the KB2919355 update installed on your computer, you can check through Windows Update.

If you get an error such "A project with an output type of class library cannot be started directly.In order to debug this project, add an executable project to this solution which references the library project. Set the executable project as the startup project" then in that case you should go to the Project in the solution explorer and right click on the projects and change the startup project to the project we are using as a console application.
